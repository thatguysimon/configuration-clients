# while we might end up using a different contextual environments pipeline
# (for example: staging -> production or qa -> staging -> production )
# the below is a tool to defining the actual context based on branch name.add()
# Based on the current logic implemented via config-context, the below suggests that:
#
# "production" branch is production
# "dev" or "develop" branch names are dev
# "qa" branch name is qa
# "staging" is the branch name and SO ARE ALL THE REST (anything other than production, dev, develop, qa) is staging!
#
# the context is majorly used in order to determine the below functionality:
# 1. what vault name to pull secrets from (secret/staged/* vs secret/qa/* etc)
# 2. Legacy hard coded conditions refering to different env based behavior.
# 3. Cluster to apply deployment to (yet not impl)
